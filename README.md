##Autonomous AI Voice Agent (Local & Open-Source)
Project Overview

This project implements a local, autonomous AI voice agent designed to handle a narrow, real-world customer support scenario:

Requesting and negotiating a subscription cancellation

The goal of this assignment is not to build a general-purpose conversational AI, but to demonstrate:

Strong system design

Goal-oriented dialogue control

Context awareness through explicit memory

Safe and explainable autonomy

All components run locally, using only open-source models, with no paid or hosted APIs.
